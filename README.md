# biomedical_segmentation
CNN developed on Tensorflow and Keras for colon adenocarcinoma image segmentation.

The aim of this CNN is to perform image segmentation of input colon adenocarcinoma based on QuPath annotations.

# abstract
Colon adenocarcinoma is one of the cancer types with the highest incidence in the population. Since early diagnosis and treatment are essential to achieve a higher survival rate, it is necessary to implement screening programs that allow periodic analysis of the population segments at the highest risk of contracting it. One of the most common diagnostic methods used by health systems is the analysis of histological samples. The visual analysis of such samples requires a great deal of time on the part of experts. Therefore, it is convenient to develop a tool that speeds up this work for pathologists. Since this is a computer vision task, and that in recent years artificial intelligence has shown great potential in this field, it has been decided to use artificial neural networks in order to develop this tool. However, one of the main obstacles usually found in this kind of biomedical field developments is the lack of quality data needed to train the neural networks. For this reason, multiple techniques have been applied to help alleviate this drawback, allowing a reasonably accurate system to be obtained from a limited set of images.

# proyect structure
The project is divided into two subprojects. On the one hand, a neural network responsible for the semantic segmentation of the tissues present in the sample has been created. On the other hand, another neural network has been created in charge of segmenting the regions of the image affected by the tumor. Finally, the inference folder contains the interface that unifies both systems.

## [database structure:](https://github.com/julenbhy/biomedical_segmentation/tree/master/tissue_segmentation/database)
The database containing the training images. Requieres the following format in order to use keras.flow_from_directory() function:
There are two databases, one in the tissue_segmentation and other for tumor_segmentation.

    .
    ├── ...
    ├── database              # database root directory
    │   ├── images
    │   │   ├── img
    │   │   │   ├── image1.jpg   # input image and annotation filenames must match in both direcotries.
    │   │   │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   │   │   ├── image3.jpg
    │   │   │   ├── ...
    │   ├── masks
    │   │   ├── img
    │   │   │   ├── image1.png
    │   │   │   ├── image2.png
    │   │   │   ├── image3.png
    │   │   │   ├── ...

The directory structure is already created at this project so that only the images have to be copied.

Tissue image example:

```images:```
<img width="200" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/julenbhy/biomedical_segmentation/blob/master/tissue_segmentation/database/images/img/10-1960%20HEN.jpg"> 
```masks:```
<img width="200" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/julenbhy/biomedical_segmentation/blob/master/tissue_segmentation/database/masks/img/10-1960%20HEN.png">

```Pixel values:``` 0 = backgroud, 225 = mucosa, 178 = linfocitos, 96 = submucosa, 131 = muscular, 105 = subserosa

Tumor image example:

```images:```
<img width="200" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/julenbhy/biomedical_segmentation/blob/master/tissue_segmentation/database/images/img/.jpg"> 
```masks:```
<img width="200" alt="portfolio_view" src="https://github.com/julenbhy/biomedical_segmentation/blob/master/tissue_segmentation/database/masks/img/.png">

```Pixel values:``` 0 = backgroud, 225 = tumor

Masks must be single channel png images.

## tile_database
The database containing the training images divided in tiles generated by tile sampling. This is done with two objectives, firstly, to generate square-shaped images, and secondly, as a data augmentation technique.
